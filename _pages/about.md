I am a PhD candidate at [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/electrical-computer/), advised by [Dr. Wei Gao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~weigao/). I received my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from the [University of Science and Technology of China](ustc.edu.cn) in 2019. 

My research focuses on **mobile sensing** and **AI for healthcare**. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to **robotics**, **IoT** and other practical scenarios.

Research Highlights
======
## [Smartphone-based Acoustic Sensing for Pulmonary Disease Evaluation](https://pittisl.github.io/publication/2023-ptease/)
We developed a mobile health system that turns a commodity smartphone into a fully functional pulmonary examination device that measures the internal physiological conditions of human airways via acoustic sensing through mouth. Since 2020, our integrated AI and sensing systems, namely **PTEase** or Acoustic Waveform Respiratory Evaluation (**AWARE**), have been applied to and tested on more than 400 patients with various pulmonary diseases at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Our work was published at [SenSys'22](https://doi.org/10.1145/3560905.3568437) and [MobiSys'23](https://doi.org/10.1145/3581791.3596854). We also published the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ericyxy98/AWARE) of human airway measurements, containing airway measurements of 382 human subjects with various pulmonary diseases and healthy control subjects collected over the past years.
